# MoveMouse
Python based mouse-moving simulator - easy alternative to the Move Mouse application.

Companies are cracking down on mouse moving applications, but some software engineers/data scientists/data engineers find it useful to have an applicaiton that can keep the screen awake for long running scripts, etc.

This program simply moves the mouse every 5 minutes and will not be detected nor removed by any company wide 3rd party search application(s) (whereas Move Mouse will be detected and removed).

## How to Use
Simply click the shortcut 'Run_Move_Mouse' program and a console window will appear giving users a countdown to when the mouse will move.

Done. Easy Peasy.

This program also uses less cpu/memory versus Move Mouse, which is just icing on the cake.
